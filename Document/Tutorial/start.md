```

Currently, it supports **Windows** only. To start the interactive shell, open **Command Prompt** and type:

```
mer
```

Example session:

```
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.26100.4652]

### Debugging with `merc`

If you want to see **how your commands are processed by the compiler**, MercuryLang provides a debug tool called `merc`. It will show each compilation and execution step:

```
