# String Expressions in MercuryLang

In MercuryLang, **string expressions** are used for handling text instead of math operations.

A **string** can contain:

* **Single characters**: `!`, `@`, `?`, etc.
* **Words**: `hello`, `MercuryLang`
* **Sentences**: `Hello, world!`

Strings are **enclosed in double quotes** (`" "`) so the MercuryLang compiler can recognize them as string literals. If you forget the quotes, the compiler will report an error.

```
> print("Hello, world!");
Hello, world!
>
```

---

## **Escaping Characters**

MercuryLang treats the **second** `"` as the **end of the string**. If you want to include a double quote **inside** the string, escape it with a backslash `\`:

```
> print("\"this is a string\"")
"this is a string"
>
```

The backslash allows you to store any character, including a `"`, inside a string.

## **Using `+` and `*` with Strings**

MercuryLang supports `+` and `*` operators for strings.

### **Concatenation with `+`**

```mercury
a = "hello, "
b = "world"
print(a + b) # Output: hello, world
```

### **Repetition with `*`**

```mercury
a = "hello"
a *= 2
print(a) # Output: hellohello
```

---

## **Accessing Strings by Index**

Strings are **zero-indexed**, meaning the first character is at index `0`. Use square brackets to access an element:

```
let a = "hello";
print(a[0])
```

If you try to access an index that doesnâ€™t exist, MercuryLang will return an error.

## **String Manipulation**

Strings in MercuryLang can be manipulated with built-in functions. The `sub` function is used to **join** multiple strings together:

```
> print(sub("hello", "world"));
"hello world"
>
```

The `sub` function provides a simple way to join strings.

## **Converting Other Types to Strings**

You can convert other types (like numbers) to strings using the `to_str` function:

```
> print(to_str(123)); # Convert number into string
123.0000000

> print(sub(to_str(1), ".000000"));
1.0000000.000000
```

Here, `to_str` turns a number into a string, which can then be combined with other strings using functions like `sub`.
