# ü™ê *Mercury Programming Language*

Welcome to ```MercuryLang``` version ```2.0.1b``` a test version of ```2.0.1```, a simple interpreter by ```C++``` programming language inspired by Python. Mercury is designed for clean, readable, and powerful code, making it ideal for developers of all levels.

## üåü Features

- **Python-like Syntax**: Intuitive and easy-to-read code.
- **Datatype warring**: You don't need worry to much about datatyped
- **Custom Functions**: Create flexible functions with ease.
- **Error Handling**: Debug efficiently with clear error messages.
- **Extensive Standard Library**: Tools for data manipulation, file handling, and more.

## üìí Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using MercuryLang v1.5.0, ensure you have:
- A C++17 (or later) compatible compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`, or MSVC)
- CMake (version 3.10 or later) for building the project
- A terminal or command-line environment (e.g., Bash, PowerShell)
- Git (to clone the repository)

## ‚úÖ Download
**For v1.5.0 download**
 - You can download MercuryLang repositorie, then compile ```.../v1.5.0/shell.cpp``` to ```.../v1.5.0/shell.exe```

**For v2.0.1 download**
 - You can download the program by download this program: **[MercuryLang-v2.0.1-binary-WIN](https://github.com/dinhsonhai132/MercuryLang-download/raw/refs/heads/main/MercuryLang-v2.0.1-binary-WINx64.exe)**

## üîß Language Syntax
### Variable
```mercury
 LET INT x = 2;
 LET FLOAT y = 3.2;
 LET STRING z = "hello";
 PRINT x + y;
```
### Functions
 Define functions with parameters:
 ```mercury
FUNC add(&x, &y) DO PRINT &x + &y END;
 !add(1, 2);
```
 ### Compair
 Mercury include a large compair operators
 ```mercury
 PRINT 1 == 1; /* value will be 1(true) or 0(false) */
 LET INT x = 2;
 LET INT y = 5;
 PRINT x <= 2;
 PRINT x > 4;
 PRINT x != y;
 ```
### Control Flow
 Mercury includes standard control flow statements:
 ```mercury
 LET INT x = 0;
 IF x > 0 THEN PRINT "x is greater than zero" END ELSE PRINT "x is not greater than zero" END;
 ++x;
 IF x != 1 THEN PRINT "x is not 1" END ELIF x == 1 THEN PRINT "x is 1" END;
 ```
### For loop
```mercury
/* for loop in list */
 
 LIST a = [4, 3, 2, 5, 3];
 FOR i IN @a DO PRINT i;
 
 /* for loop in range */
 
 FOR i IN 1 TO 10 DO PRINT i END;
 ```
### Lists
 Create and manipulate lists:
 ```mercury
 LIST a = [1, 2, 3, 4];
 PRINT @a -> 1; /* first element start with 1 */
 ```
### While loop
 ```mercury
 LET INT x = 0;
 WHILE x < 10 DO ++x; PRINT x END;
 ```
 ### Code block
 ```mercury
 /*code block store multiline */
 ... DO (code_block) END;
 ```

## üîß Language Syntax For v2.0.1 binary

### Variable
```mercury
 LET x = 2
 LET y = 3.2
```
### Functions
 Define functions with parameters:
 ```mercury
FUNC foo() DO
LET x = 1
LET y = 2
x + y
END
```
