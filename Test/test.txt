                             THIS IS A TEST FILE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This folder, named `Test`, is very important.  
It helps the program-building process by clearly identifying where errors occur.

Please ensure:
- All test cases are placed here.
- Each test should include input and expected output.
- If a test fails, its location and description will help with debugging.

The error will be written in makefile
